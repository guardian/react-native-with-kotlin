# React Native with Kotlin Native

This is a "hello world" example of a React Native application which includes a
["native module"](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/native-modules-setup) (`NativeModules.Greeting`) which
is in turn implemented using [Kotlin multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/native/mpp-ios-android.html).
